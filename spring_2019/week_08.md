## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I continued working on making course sections editable. Right now, I have it so that all the correct section data is displayed when you edit a course. I didn't get as much done as I had hoped, but I still made some progress. 

## This Week's Plan

Next week, I want to finish the forms so that that any changes will show up in the rest of yacs. After that, the edit feature should be pretty much complete.

## Anything Blocking?

I had an issue with reusing some functions for section data. There was already a section component in another part of YACS, but I couldn't reuse any of it in my code. If I end up copying a lot of the functionality, I might refactor it but otherwise I'll leave the old code alone.

## Notes

Course sections are the individual class times during the week. 
So one class with two sections might have one section at 10-12 Monday, Thursday and 
the second section is 2-4 Tuesday, Friday.
