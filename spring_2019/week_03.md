## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I continued working on the UI formatting for the course listing edit view. I wasn't sure how to go ahead with connecting the forms to the yacs service, but I got some help and figured out how to deal with that. 

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to try and finish hooking all the forms up so they are actually functional. It should be easier than I originally thought it would be so this shouldn't take that long.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers.

## Notes

Decided not to work on the tests since that's low priority.
