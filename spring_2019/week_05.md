## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I finished the edit view for listings. Users can click an edit button on a listing and can then input fields for the number of credits and description of a listing. Saving the changes will then update that listing in the rest of yacs. Adding functionality to the form elements was actually really simple. With Graphiti, you can just call #save() on a model instance. This was way easier than the previous yacs-admin.

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to work on the UI formatting of the forms. I also need to add the course name as a field so a course's name can be changed. A course would then be identified by its short name i.e. CSCI 1200 instead of Data Structures.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers right now.
