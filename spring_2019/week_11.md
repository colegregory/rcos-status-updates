## Semester Review

I am very pleased with the progress I made this semester on Yacs Admin. I remember the previous version of Yacs Admin took over two semesters to just get the app working with real data. Also, we had two people on the admin team back then, wheras now I am pretty much the only person working on Yacs Admin. So, I'm proud of the fact that I was able to get a basic version of Yacs admin up and running with real data and with the same functionality of the old app. 

I also learned quite a lot this semester. Coming back to Yacs after a semester away was a little challenging at first with all the new developments, but I eventually got up to speed. I also focused more on the backend this semester. Most of my previous development experience had been strictly frontend and I wanted to learn more about other areas. In particular, learning about the Yacs API and APIs in general was super useful and I think I'll be able to apply that knowledge in the future. 

Some things I didn't get to and want to implement for the future are user authentication as well as more detailed admin functionality. I didn't quite finish adding all editable attributes (you can't edit part of a courses section) so that will defiinitely be the first thing to work on moving forward. I'm really excited for the future of Yacs Admin and it will be really cool when we get accounts for users so they can actually start using the feature.

Also, thanks the the rest of the Yacs team. Even though I was the only working on the admin feature, everyone else did a great job this semester. Overall, a lot of work got done compared to previous semesters.
