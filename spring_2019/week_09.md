## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I worked more on the admin feature. Getting the forms correctly formatted has been a little more work than I thought it had been. The functionality is done though, so sections can be modified.
I also fixed a bug with course section conflicts. It was just a typo.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to have everything working for the admin feature before the presentation next week.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers.
