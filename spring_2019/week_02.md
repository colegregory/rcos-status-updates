## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I completed implementing a basic version of the detail view that would let a user edit course listings. So far, it is just basic mockup; there is no formatting of the UI elements and no services are linked so listings can't actually be changed. 

## This Week's Plan

This week I'm going to continue working on the new listing-detail module. I hope to get it functioning by the end of the week and I'll work on visual formatting later.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking. I'm unsure on some of the UI formatting but I might just delegate that to someone else.

## Notes

I noticed some of the tests are out of date, so I plan to work on that in the future as well.
