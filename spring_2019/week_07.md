## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I began working on adding more functionality to the edit feature. The goal is for users to be able to edit the individual sections of a course in addition to editing the course listing. So far, I have made some progress on getting the back end implemented. 

## This Week's Plan

Next week, I plan to continue working on this feature. I think I will be able to finish implementing the physical components. If I get that done, I'll work on making the appearance match the rest of the form. 

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers.

## Notes

I haven't looked any further into a user authentication / login system.
