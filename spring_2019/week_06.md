## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week I finished up the listing-detail component. Users can now change a listing's name and listings are then distinguished by subject/course name i.e. CSCI 1200. I also changed the apperance of the forms so everything matches the look and feel of the rest of YACS. I updated my pull request with these new changes and added some screenshots on github. 

## This Week's Plan

I plan on working on a way to edit sections. Just like course listings, professors should be able to edit the details of their course sections. I think I will just add this onto the listing edit view as that would be simplest to implement. It also might be easier for users to be able to edit everything in one place.

## Anything Blocking?

No blockers right now.

## Notes
Another feature to add in the future is a user authentication / login system.
